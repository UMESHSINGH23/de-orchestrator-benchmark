# End-to-End Data Pipeline with Apache Airflow

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline built using Apache Airflow. 
The pipeline covers data ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

The goal is to showcase how real-world data science projects are structured and automated.
